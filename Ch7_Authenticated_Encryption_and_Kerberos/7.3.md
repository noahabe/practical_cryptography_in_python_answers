> EXERCISE 7.3 SPEEDY CHACHA
> 
> Create some speed comparison tests for AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and 
> ChaCha20-Poly1305. Run one set of tests where a large amount 
> of data is fed into each encrypt function exactly once. Test 
> the speed of the decryption algorithm as well. Note that this 
> also tests the tag check. 
> 
> Run a second set of tests where large data is broken into smaller 
> chunks (perhaps 4KiB each), and each chunk is individually 
> encrypted.
