    "> EXERCISE 7.5: KERBERIZE THE ECHO PROTOCOL\n",
    "> \n",
    "> We didn't show any code for a Kerberized echo protocol. We've left that \n",
    "> for you to figure out. We have already set up some of the pieces you need, \n",
    "> however. In real Kerberos, a Kerberized service has to be registered with the \n",
    "> TGS. We have already done that. Our TGS code has \"echo\" in the service \n",
    "> database with a password \"sunshine\". \n",
    "> \n",
    "> You will need to modify the echo client and echo server to use the session key \n",
    "> from the TGS instead of deriving the session keys from a password. You can treat the \n",
    "> session key from the TGS as key material and still use the HKDF to derive the write key \n",
    "> and read key (two sub-session keys, as Kerberos would call them). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Many Kerberized implementations accept the ticket along with the request, and you can \n",
    "> do the same here. In other words, send the Kerberos message along with the (encrypted) \n",
    "> data to be echoed. Because you are sending a human-readable message, you can use \n",
    "> the null terminator to indicate the end of the echo message and the beginning of the \n",
    "> Kerberos message, if that's easiest. Alternatively, you could do something more complicated \n",
    "> like transmit the Kerberos message first, perpended by its length, with the human-readable\n",
    "> echo message as a trailer. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The server will also need to be modified to accept a password for deriving its key with the \n",
    "> TGS. The server already has a password given as a parameter. You could simply change \n",
    "> it to derive its Kerberos key instead of the read and write keys. Also, make sure to use \n",
    "> the appropriate derivation function. The read and write keys will need to be derived in the \n",
    "> `data_received` method after the ticket is received and decrypted. You can leave out the optional \n",
    "> Kerberos response to the echo client. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Finally, you will have to figure out a way to get the Kerberos ticket data to the echo client. You \n",
    "> can either build the echo client protocol directly into your Kerberos client or find some other \n",
    "> way to transfer it. \n",
