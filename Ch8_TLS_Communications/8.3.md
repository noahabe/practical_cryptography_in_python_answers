> Exercise 8.3: FANTASY CERTIFICATES 
> 
> Creae some "fantasy" certificates for some of your favorite 
> organizations. Self-sign a certificate or two that reads 
> `amazon.com` or `google.com`. You can't use these as nobody's 
> browser will accept them. But it is kind of a fun game. 
> 
> Maybe you could print out a copy of Openssl's text representation 
> and frame it. After all, how many of your friends have an 
> Amazon TLS certificate?
