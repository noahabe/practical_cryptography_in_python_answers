--------------------------------

We just have to change the `generate` function inside of `ex4_4.py` (look at solution of 
Exercise 4.4). 

The following might be a good replacement: 

```python
def generate(dictionary_path: str): 
    with open(dictionary_path, 'r') as f: 
        for single_line in f: 
            yield single_line
    return 
```
