> EXERCISE 4.8: EVE'S PROTEGE
> 
> Recreate Eve's chosen ciphertext attack. Create a sample message in 
> Python, as you have done previously, using the public key to encrypt it. 
> Then, encrypt a value of $r$ (such as $2$). Multiply the two _numeric_
> versions of the ciphertext together and don't forget to take the answer 
> modulo $n$. Decrypt this new ciphertext and try to convert it to bytes. 
> It shouldn't be anything human readable. Take the numeric version of this 
> decryption and multiply it by the inverse of $r \: (\text{mod} \: n)$. You 
> should be back to the orginal number. Convert it to bytes
> to see the orginal message.
