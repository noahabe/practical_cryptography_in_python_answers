--------------------------------

If Eve has a guess of what Alice is sending to Bob, all she needs to do is encrypt her 
guess by using the Bob's public key and the RSA encryption program. Then she compares
the ciphertext that she generated with what came from Alice. If they are the same, then 
that means her guess was correct. Otherwise, incorrect.
