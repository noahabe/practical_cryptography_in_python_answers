--------------------------------

Well, Eve can generate her own keys (lets suppose they are stored in the files 
`eve_private_key.txt` and `eve_public_key.txt`). Then she advertises her public key
(`eve_public_key.txt`) as if it is Bob's public key. 

Alice will use Eve's public key (thinking she is using the correct Bob's public key)
, encrypt her messages and sends them off. Eve being the MITM, will intercept this message
and decrypt it (she can do this because it is encrypted by her public key).

Then Eve can edit the message sent by Alice, and re-encrypt the edited message by using 
Bob's public key. She then sends this ciphertext to Bob as if it came from Alice.
