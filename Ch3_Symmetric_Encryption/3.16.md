The following picture shows XORing two plaintext messages:

It is very hard for the attacker to get `msg1` and `msg2` from the 
XOR. For example, the first byte of `msg1` is `h` and the first byte 
of `msg2` is `b`. XOR of their ASCII values gives 10. If you try to XOR 
every pair of lowercase letters ($26 \times 26 = 676$ pairs) and check if 
they give a value of 10, you will find 20 possibilities. They are:

Bottom line, don't reuse key/IV pair.
