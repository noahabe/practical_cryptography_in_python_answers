> **DES**? What is its key size? How does **3DES** strengthen **DES**? 

--------------------------------

The block size of **DES** is $64$ bits. 

The key size of **DES** is $56$ bits. 

**3DES** strengthens **DES** by increasing its key size. When using Keying Option 1
(read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES#:~:text=three%20keying%20options%3A-,Keying%20option%201,-All%20three%20keys)) **3DES** will have $3$ independent keys each of 
size $56$ bits. Thus the key size for **3DES** is $3 \times 56 = 168$ bits. 
But it is still vulnerable to [meet-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack), 
but the attack requires $2^{2 \times 56}$ steps.
