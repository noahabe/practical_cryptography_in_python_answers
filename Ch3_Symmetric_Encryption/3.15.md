--------------------------------

Suppose the following code is inside of a file called `ex3_15.py`.

```python
# ex3_15.py

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
import os 

class CTR: 
    def __init__(self): 
        self.preshared_key = bytes.fromhex("6ae8ec45144e0e1f7557c47e0414b5e4")
        self.preshared_iv = bytes.fromhex("0156b06a05b32e0da4b84e20bbb8e2a6")

        self.aesContext = Cipher(
            algorithm=algorithms.AES(self.preshared_key),
            mode=modes.CTR(self.preshared_iv), 
            backend=default_backend(),
        )
        self.encryptor = self.aesContext.encryptor()
        self.decryptor = self.aesContext.decryptor() 

def generate_msg(merchant: str, buyer: str, date: str, amount: str, cc: str): 
    return "<XML>\n"\
    "<CreditCardPurchase>\n"\
    f"<Merchant>{merchant}</Merchant>\n"\
    f"<Buyer>{buyer}</Buyer>\n"\
    f"<Date>{date}</Date>\n"\
    f"<Amount>{amount}</Amount\n"\
    f"<CCNumber>{cc}</CCNumber>\n"\
    "</CreditCardPurchase>\n"\
    "</XML>"

msg1 = generate_msg(
    merchant="Acme Inc", 
    buyer="John Smith", 
    date="01/01/2001", 
    amount="$100.00", 
    cc="555-555-555-555"
)

msg2 = generate_msg(
    merchant="HelloWorld INC", 
    buyer="Harry Potter", 
    date="01/01/2091", 
    amount="$340.00", 
    cc="555-555-555-678"
)


# the following function is taken from Exercise 3.9. 
def xor_two_byte_strings(x: bytes, y: bytes) -> bytes: 
    assert(len(x) == len(y))
    
    result = []
    for _1, _2 in zip(x, y): 
        result.append(_1 ^ _2)
    return bytes(result)
```

Now, open up an interactive python interpreter and import it: 
<img src="ex3_15_fig1.png">

Then encrypt `msg1` and `msg2` using AES-CTR: 
<img src="ex3_15_fig2.png">

Suppose now, the attacker knows `msg1` and `ciphertext_1`. Thus 
he can generate the beginning parts of the keystream as follows: 
<img src="ex3_15_fig3.png">

The following screenshot shows how the attacker can hack into 
`ciphertext_2` (or at least the first 196 bytes of it).
<img src="ex3_15_fig4.png">

Since the attacker knows the first 196 bytes of the keystream, he can 
hack into the first 196 bytes of any ciphertext that gets encrypted by the 
`CTR` class given above.

Note that the major flaw in this operation was that the programmers used
the same key/IV pair for encrypting two different messages.
