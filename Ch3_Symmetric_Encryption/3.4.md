--------------------------------

Little note on RC4: It is a stream cipher. While it is remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, multiple 
vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4).
RC4 was used in [WEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy), 
[WPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access), [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer), 
and even [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) until it was prohibited in 2015, by RFC 7465.     

Little note on Twofish: Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of $128$ bits and key 
sizes up to $256$ bits. Twofish's distinctive features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent 
[S-boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-box), and a relatively complex 
[key schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_schedule).
