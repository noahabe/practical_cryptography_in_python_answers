--------------------------------

Since we know that 5^9 = 12, we can deduce that 

12 ^ 9 = (5 ^ 9) ^ 9 = 5 ^ (9 ^ 9) = 5 ^ 0 = 5 

and 

12 ^ 5 = (5 ^ 9) ^ 5 = (9 ^ 5) ^ 5 = 9 ^ (5 ^ 5) = 9 ^ 0 = 9

Fun facts abot XOR: 

1. XOR can be considered as the addition-modulo $2$ operator in $\Z _2$ and 
hence satisfies the following properties: 
    1. Associativity: (a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
    2. Identity Element: 0
    3. Commutativity: a ^ b = b ^ a 
    4. The inverse of bit 0 is 0. The inverse of bit 1 is 1. 

2. a ^ a = 0 
3. a ^ 0 = a
