Before doing this question, I recommend that you do [Exercise 3.15](3.15.md)
they are very similar. In fact we are going to use the code given there as a library. 

First, find & define your `original_header` and calculate the length of the header.

Define your `plaintext` and `ciphertext`:

XOR the plaintext header with the ciphertext header to get the _keystream_:

Once you have this, XOR the extracted keystream with a header identifying 
Evil LLC as the merchant. This is the "evil" ciphertext.

Copy the "evil" header over the bytes of the encrypted file to create a new payment message
identifying your company as the recipient. Prove that it works by decrypting the modified 
file.
