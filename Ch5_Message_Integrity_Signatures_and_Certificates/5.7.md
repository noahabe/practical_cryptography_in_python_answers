I feel like, if you understand the previous exercise, this one should be 
easy. 

But the following, are things to recall: 

1. **Encrypt-Then-MAC**: Encrypt the plaintext. Then apply the MAC over the 
ciphertext. (This is what we did in the previous exercise.)

2. **MAC-Then-Encrypt**: Perform the MAC on the plaintext. Then you encrypt
both the plaintext & the MAC. 

3. **Encrypt-And-MAC**: Perform the MAC on the plaintext. Then you send the 
ciphertext and MAC. MAC is not encrypted.
