> EXERCISE 5.3: BRUTE FORCE AGAIN
> 
> You should already have done some brute-force 
> attacks in previous chapters, but it's important
> to repeat the exercise until you develop intuition 
> for the concept. Using our preceding fake HMAC,
> have the computer generate a random password 
> of specific sizes and use brute-force methods 
> to find out what it is. To be more specific, 
> assume that you already know what the 
> message is (e.g. "hello world", "happy birthday", 
> or a message of your choosing). Write a program 
> to create a random password of characters, 
> prepend the password to the message, and then 
> print out the MAC (hash). Take the output 
> and iterate through all possible passwords
> until you find the right one. Start with a simple
> test of a single-letter character, then try two 
> characters, and so forth. Mix things up by using 
> different sets of characters such as all 
> lowercase, lowercase and uppercase, either 
> case plus numbers, and so forth.
